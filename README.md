# Yiffer.xyz Remix <-> Database Bridge

This will most be a temporary thing, until we implement Cloudflare's D1 SQL. Run this alongside the main Remix API to serve as the bridge between that and the database.

## Setup

Add a `config` folder at root level, and `cfg.yml` inside of it. Ask Melon for contents.

Run `yarn` to install, and run it with `yarn dev`.
